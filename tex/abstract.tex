Equational unification is an important research area with many applications,
such as cryptographic protocol analysis, automated theorem proving, and
automated reasoning. In ``Unification modulo
Chaining''~\cite{anantharaman2012unification}, an algorithm is presented for
solving unification problems modulo a theory of chaining. The algorithm is
modular in the sense that it does not depend on the interpretation of the
elements in the lists, but is instead parameterized by a suitable element
unification algorithm. We present an implementation of this algorithm in the
Maude programming language.

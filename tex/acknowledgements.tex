I would first like to thank my advisor, Paliath Narendran. It is due to his
guidance and insight that I chose not only this line of research, but to enter
the Ph.D.\ program in the first place. I would like to thank my coauthors on
``Unification modulo Chaining,'' Siva Anantharaman, Dr.\ Narendran, and
Micha\"{e}l Rusinowitch, for their patience and expertise while I learned the
ropes of academic writing.

I would like to thank my academic older brothers, Andrew Marshall and Serdar
Erbatur, for taking the time to mentor and encourage a first year grad student.
I now \emph{ful{}ly} understand how busy they must have been. I would also like
to thank my friends and teammates, Kim Gero, Peter Hibbs, and Andrew ``Basil''
Matusiewicz, for making this department a place that I look forward to going
to. This journey would have been much more arduous without their camaraderie.

I would like to thank my parents for their continued support. And I would like
to thank my fianc\'{e}e, Mary Ferro, for more than I can say. Beyond just
listening to my babbling about algorithms and ``the paper'', her love and
belief in me when I had lost my confidence have kept me going. Thank you.
